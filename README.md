# E-Commerce Website

## Overview

Welcome to the repository of our Eteration E-Commerce website. This platform provides a seamless shopping experience for a variety of products. With an intuitive interface, customers can filter products, add them to their basket, and perform searches across the catalog.

## Features

- **Filtering Options**: Users can filter products based on various criteria such as 'Old to New', 'New to Old', 'Price High to Low', and 'Price Low to High'.
- **Search Functionality**: A general search feature that allows users to search any text visible on the product cards.
- **Persistent Shopping Basket**: Utilizing `localStorage`, the site remembers the user's basket items even after closing the browser.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with Material UI, the interface adapts to various screen sizes for an optimal browsing experience.
- **State Management**: `Recoil` is used for global state management across components.
- **Routing**: `react-router-dom` is used for navigating between different pages of the website.
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suites are written for each component under the `__test__` directory to ensure reliability and maintainability.

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
